# geeasy 0.1.1

* 2022-01-05

* Fixed minor issues before package can go on CRAN

# geeasy 0.1.0

* 2022-01-03

* First upload of geeasy package. The geeasy code is greatly inspired
  by the geeM package, but the geeasy code is more modularized and
  hence easier to maintain and extent. The package is, among other
  things, intended to be the workhorse behind the geeglm function in
  the geepack package.
