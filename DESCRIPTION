Description: Estimation of generalized linear models with correlated/clustered observations
    by use of generalized estimating equations (GEE). Several types of clustering are supported,
    including exchangeable variance structures, AR1 structures, M-dependent, user-specified 
    variance structures and more. The model fitting computations are performed using modified
    code from the geeM package, while the interface and output objects have been written 
    to resemble the geepack package. The package also contains further tools for working with
    and inspecting results from the geepack package, e.g. a confint() method for geepack's 
    geeglm objects.
